## What is Hosting

- Web hosting is an online service that enables you to publish your website or web application on the internet.

- When you sign up for a web hosting service, you basically rent some space on a physical server where you can store all the files and data necessary for your website to work properly.
- Once a user enters your domain name into their browser’s address bar, the web host’s server will transfer all the files necessary to load your website.
